# raspberry-pi-config
Repeatable configuration set(s) for new Raspberry Pi post-install 

## Summary
This repository contains a set of **repeatable configuration scripts** designed to automate the post-installation setup for a Raspberry Pi. The goal is to provide a quick, reliable, and consistent way to get a new Raspberry Pi ready for use in a home lab or any other project, allowing you to easily **rebuild your environment** from scratch.

## Context
As a home lab user, it's common to experiment with configurations and software that may "break" the system. This repository provides a **clean and documented method** for recovering from such incidents by starting with a fresh Raspberry Pi OS install and then executing a single script to install all necessary packages, configure services, and apply custom settings. This approach saves time and ensures a predictable setup every time. The scripts are designed to be **idempotent**, meaning you can run them multiple times without causing errors, which is useful for updating an existing system or ensuring all configurations are in place.

## Usage

**Disclaimer:** This repository and its scripts are provided for educational and learning purposes only. They are based on personal configurations and preferences, and as such, there is no guarantee of their suitability or correctness for your specific use case.

You are solely responsible for understanding the contents of these scripts before you execute them. Running a shell script from the internet can pose a significant security risk. It is highly recommended that you fork this repository and review every line of code to ensure it aligns with your security needs and goals.

By using the scripts in this repository, you acknowledge and agree that you are doing so at your own risk. The creator of this repository is not responsible for any damage, data loss, or system instability that may occur.

**Quick Start (for experienced users)**
To run the main setup script, execute the following command on your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
# Example command - you should replace the URL with your own repository's raw script link
curl -sL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/raspberry-pi-config/main/setup.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/raspberry-pi-config/main/setup.sh) | bash
```
